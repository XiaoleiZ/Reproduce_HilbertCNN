# Reproduce HilbertCNN

Implement the sequence representation and DNN model in Keras in the 2018 ICLR paper - [An image representation based convolutional network for DNA classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04931) https://github.com/Doulrs/Hilbert-CNN

## Usage

```
python hilbertCNN.py ./data/data.txt
```

## Demo in Ipython Notebook

## Claim

The image of the HilbertCNN architecture is captured from the paper.
All data files in the data folder are from the paper. 

## ToDo

The performance hasn't been reproduced as it is described in the paper. There could be several reasons:

- Training hyperparameters
- Not totally same CNN architecture as described in the paper

Improvements:

- How does it make sense biologically?
